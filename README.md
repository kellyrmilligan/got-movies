## GoTickets Movies!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Other technologies:

- [https://tailwindcss.com/](Tailwind css)
- [https://daisyui.com/](Daisy ui) - component library built on tailwind
- [https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript](openapi typescript) - cli to generate types from open api spec, along with open api fetch library that consumes the generated types
- [https://usehooks.com/](useHooks) - hook library, used for local storage and client/server detection

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
